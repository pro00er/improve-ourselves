### Data Science at Netflix

Netflix revolutionized how we watch movies and TV. Currently over 75
million users watch 125 million hours of Netflix content every day!

Netflix's revenue comes from a monthly subscription service. So, the
goal for Netflix is to keep you subscribed and to get new subscribers.

To achieve this, Netflix is licensing movies from studios as well as
creating its own original movies and TV series.

But offering new content is not everything. What is also very important
is, to keep you watching content that already exists.

To be able to recommend you content, Netflix is collecting data from
users. And it is collecting a lot.

Currently, Netflix analyses about 500 billion user events per day. That
results in a stunning 1.3 Petabytes every day.

All this data allows Netflix to build recommender systems for you. The
recommenders are showing you content that you might like, based on your
viewing habits, or what is currently trending.

###### The Netflix batch processing pipeline

When Netflix started out, they had a very simple batch processing system
architecture.

The key components were Chuckwa, a scalable data collection system,
Amazon S3 and Elastic MapReduce.

![Old Netflix Batch Processing
Pipeline[]{label="fig:Bild1"}](/images/Netflix-Chuckwa-Pipeline.jpg){#fig:Bild1
width="90%"}

Chuckwa wrote incoming messages into Hadoop sequence files, stored in
Amazon S3. These files then could be analysed by Elastic MapReduce jobs.

Netflix batch processing pipeline Jobs were executed regularly on a
daily and hourly basis. As a result, Netflix could learn how people used
the services every hour or once a day.

###### Know what customers want:

Because you are looking at the big picture you can create new products.
Netflix uses insight from big data to create new TV shows and movies.

They created House of Cards based on data. There is a very interesting
TED talk about this you should watch:

[How to use data to make a hit TV show \| Sebastian
Wernicke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQILP19qABk)

Batch processing also helps Netflix to know the exact episode of a TV
show that gets you hooked. Not only globally but for every country where
Netflix is available.

Check out the article from TheVerge

They know exactly what show works in what country and what show does
not.

It helps them create shows that work in everywhere or select the shows
to license in different countries. Germany for instance does not have
the full library that Americans have :(

We have to put up with only a small portion of TV shows and movies. If
you have to select, why not select those that work best.

###### Batch processing is not enough

As a data platform for generating insight the Cuckwa pipeline was a good
start. It is very important to be able to create hourly and daily
aggregated views for user behavior.

To this day Netflix is still doing a lot of batch processing jobs.

The only problem is: With batch processing you are basically looking
into the past.

For Netflix, and data driven companies in general, looking into the past
is not enough. They want a live view of what is happening.

###### The trending now feature

One of the newer Netflix features is "Trending now". To the average user
it looks like that "Trending Now" means currently most watched.

This is what I get displayed as trending while I am writing this on a
Saturday morning at 8:00 in Germany. But it is so much more.

What is currently being watched is only a part of the data that is used
to generate "Trending Now".

![Netflix Trending Now
Feature[]{label="fig:Bild1"}](/images/Netflix-Trending-Now-Screenshot.jpg){#fig:Bild1
width="90%"}

"Trending now" is created based on two types of data sources: Play
events and Impression events.

What messages those two types actually include is not really
communicated by Netflix. I did some research on the Netflix Techblog and
this is what I found out:

Play events include what title you have watched last, where you did stop
watching, where you used the 30s rewind and others. Impression events
are collected as you browse the Netflix Library like scroll up and down,
scroll left or right, click on a movie and so on.

Basically, play events log what you do while you are watching.
Impression events are capturing what you do on Netflix, while you are
not watching something.

###### Netflix real-time streaming architecture

Netflix uses three internet facing services to exchange data with the
client's browser or mobile app. These services are simple Apache Tomcat
based web services.

The service for receiving play events is called "Viewing History".
Impression events are collected with the "Beacon" service.

The "Recommender Service" makes recommendations based on trend data
available for clients.

Messages from the Beacon and Viewing History services are put into
Apache Kafka. It acts as a buffer between the data services and the
analytics.

Beacon and Viewing History publish messages to Kafka topics. The
analytics subscribes to the topics and gets the messages automatically
delivered in a first in first out fashion.

After the analytics the workflow is straight forward. The trending data
is stored in a Cassandra Key-Value store. The recommender service has
access to Cassandra and is making the data available to the Netflix
client.

![Netflix Streaming
Pipeline[]{label="fig:Bild1"}](/images/Netflix-Streaming-Pipeline.jpg){#fig:Bild1
width="90%"}

The algorithms how the analytics system is processing all this data is
not known to the public. It is a trade secret of Netflix.

What is known, is the analytics tool they use. Back in Feb 2015 they
wrote in the tech blog that they use a custom made tool.

They also stated, that Netflix is going to replace the custom made
analytics tool with Apache Spark streaming in the future. My guess is,
that they did the switch to Spark some time ago, because their post is
more than a year old.
